Given an array arr[], find the maximum j â€“ i such that arr[j] > arr[i]
Input: 2 0 3 5 6 1
Output: 4
There was only one test case given which is mentioned above. But I am providing the below one of the sample cases which is an important thing to be noted. It returns -1 because all the
elements after any given element are smaller than it. DO take care of such cases.
Input: 9 8 7 6 5
Output: -1
